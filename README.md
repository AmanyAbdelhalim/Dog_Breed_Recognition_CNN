## Project: Dog Breed Recognition

### Goal of the Project
This machine learning project is designed to give hands-on experience with unsupervised learning and work towards developing conclusions for a potential client on a real-world dataset.

### Achievements
- Created a Convolutional Neural Network to Classify Dog Breeds.
- 	Used a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- 	Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- 	Created an algorithm that given an image:
1.	Detected if it is a dog or a human.
2.	Detect the dogâ€™s breed.
3.Detect a resembling dog breed for a human image.
